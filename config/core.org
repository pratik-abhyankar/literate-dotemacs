* Completions
** Which Key
Make Emacs prompt the next possible key bindings after a short while. I rely on
this a lot. Like.. a lot!
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package which-key
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq which-key-add-column-padding 1
          which-key-sort-uppercase-first nil
          which-key-show-early-on-C-h t
          which-key-idle-delay 1.0
          which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.05)
    (which-key-mode))
#+end_src

** Ivy, Counsel and Swiper
My de-facto general completion for Emacs. Install ~counsel~ and it will install
~ivy~ and ~swiper~ as its dependencies. I don't do ~Helm~ or ~Ido~, don't ask why.
