* Overview

* Getting Started

** Directory Structure

|#|File/Directory|Purpose|

** Entry Point
Emacs loads ~early-init.el~ even before ~init.el~ so setup any flags or hooks before the config loads. I use this to disable ~package.el~ at startup, since I use ~straight.el~ as my package manager.

~init.el~ then sets up ~straight.el~ and loads the rest of my literate Emacs config from the ~config/~ directory using ~org-babel-load~.

* Packages

By default, ~straight.el~ pulls and installs all packages in the ~straight/~ directory. I override this to use the ~packages/~ directory instead.
